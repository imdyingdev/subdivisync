7A. Admin > Homeowners > Add New Homeowner > after input details of homeowner when i `Create Homeowner` button there is no confirmation first it just create create without modal confirmation

7B. For Follow up in Number 7, the homeowner just created place on top not on the bottom

7C. Also, phone number should be optional

8A. In Admin > Property > Add Property Button you can see the modal and inputs there; instead `Size` use Landsize/SQM (Use `Landsize` in manage properties column list there because its `Size` is up there and the value will be like 150 SQM)

8B. For Follow up in Number 8, Size or Landsize/SQM input can input letters there? so what if we put random letters? so its error now so we need to do use numbers only and cant type characters

8C. maybe in Placeholder, remove the sqm there

8D. Another Follow up for Number 8, remove the features option and its notif, make sure it doesnt display anymore in any part it might be exist in the other area or homeowner side if not then its fine just remove that option starting now

9A.  In Admin > Property Management, when click the `View` action the size display like what we input in the Landsize/SQM but instead of that we need to concatenate the number and `SQM` right so when view all properties it indicates SQM there

9B. Follow up for 9A, since we cant enter characters in add property and just concatenate the SQM, we should apply that too in Homeowner > Browse Property, concatenate the SQM there because we cant identify what is that 

10A. in Homeowner > Browse Property, `View Details & Inquire` button should be in the bottom not like depend on the how many content in the cards so the alignment is clean

10B. same in the card, the (for example Zerina Premium and AVAILABLE FOR INQUIRY) have too much gap

11. And last,
