1. when i try reset password and put `Johngrafe123*` "the • Include at least one Special Character (! @ # $ % ^ & )" didnt color green make sure all symbols count as symbols in the label is sample only

2.in Admin > Account Security, use `Name` not `User ID` (In action button to when i unlock it shows user id there too)

3. again, in Admin > Account Security, i think `Failed Attempts` column is not necessary 

4. Admin > Account Security, when click action button unlock fix the phrase "reason to unlock" not "unlock reason" in the input

5. Admin > Account Security, add red circle notification on the right like in the Applications and Service sidebar counting how many users/homeowners locked

6. Also in login, when user locked account entering 3 times wrong password, it will email to them the information or what happened also where to contact the Admin

follow up for number 6, it shows there only


"This account has been locked

Your account has been locked for security reasons. Please contact admin or customer service to regain access.

Failed attempts: 3/3"

maybe add that its emailed

in email, it will open a form to submit a reason form like enter email again and also the reason 20 words above 

when they submit, it will go to the (add view button in the right side of actions in the account security table and we can see the reason there of submitted form by the homeowner)

if there is a submitted form the unlock account modal, remove the reason to unlock since homeowner already submitted

there is an option in the view action button also to resend new email that the reason is not enough, just put a button there and when click it will ask confirmation first if the reason is not actually valid then sent a second email for a form to reset the reason
